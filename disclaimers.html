<br>
<br>We do not sell any products that contain more than .3% THC. None of our products are intended to give you a "high," but to aid with issues like pain, anxiety, PTSD and even chronic illness when prescribed by a qualified doctor*. CBD is being researched as a safe alternative to expensive pharmaceutical drugs. <br>
<br>
<br>SHIPPING &amp; PROCESSING 
<br>We ship through a variety of freight services and sometimes personal delivery depending on the distance from Oregon. Rates are between $250 - $1000 depending on the company. If you are licensed, you can pick up hemp from us at our farm after vetting from the owners. 
<br>
<br>Our shipping will be insured up to $250,000 and we will ship a maximum of 500lbs per shipment. You can order multiple shipments, but we will intentionally put them on different trucks to ensure that one large shipment is never lost.
<br>
<br>When using our shipping services through a freight carrier, we will require signature of a sales agreement stating the shipment will be "Freight on Board" meaning the shipment is considered fulfilled on our end once we have loaded it on the 3rd party shipping services truck. The shipment is insured and sole responsibility is then turned over to the shipper and now owner of the product (you).<br>
<br>TVHF LLC accepts payments via bank transfer, cashiers check or cash with invoice.&nbsp;<br>
<br>We use plain, vacuum sealed packaging to keep our orders fresh and discreet. All sales are final. We do not offer returns or exchanges. That being said, please contact us if you have an issue and we will try to find a reasonable solution to compensate for your issue. 
<br>All orders also include a "Notice to Postmaster and Law Enforcement" in the package and an order invoice via email.

                            <p class="mbr-section-text  align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7">What is contained in this package might look like marijuana, but it is actually legal industrial hemp flower. The 2018 US Farm Bill amended Sec. 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 which re-defined hemp and it's legal status. This bill also amended Sections 102(16) and 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act to establish Hemp as a seperate crop from Marihuana and to establish that THC found in Hemp is exempted from the Controlled Substances Act. 
<br>
<br>Below are the amended Acts that make the sale of this Hemp product legal: 
<br>
<br>Sec. 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 - "The term ‘hemp’ means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, ex-tracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis." 
<br>
<br>Sec. 102(16) of the Controlled Substances Act - "The term ‘marihuana’ does not include hemp, as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.." 
<br>
<br>Sec. 202(c) of the Controlled Substances Act is a table that previously had Tetrahydrocannabinols listed as number 17 on the list of Schedule I substances. This entry has been amended and now reads: "(17) Tetrahydrocannabinols, except for tetrahydrocannabinols in hemp (as defined under section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.)"&nbsp;</p>
